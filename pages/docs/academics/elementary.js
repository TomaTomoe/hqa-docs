## Elementary Curriculum
In kindergarten through 2nd grade, your child establishes a firm foundation in reading, phonics, spelling, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies. In addition to these core subjects, instruction in art, music, technology integration, Spanish and French languages, and physical education all enhance your child’s learning experience.

Each child is individually supported in Village’s learning community with relationships and resources that foster confidence, problem solving, creativity and a love of learning.

In Grades 3 and 4, your child receives instruction that provides the best preparation for their continued learning and growth. This includes departmentalizing the 3rd and 4th grade classes, which are taught by specialized teachers.

The following teaching areas are important components of our elementary school curriculum:



## Mathematics
Our mathematics program focuses on problem solving and the development of higher-order critical thinking skills, through real world application. Our curriculum presents mathematics in a logical progression designed to reduce learning gaps, develop persistence in problem solving, and prepare students to understand advanced mathematical concepts.

## Science
Our science program is based around an integrated study of life science, Earth science and physical science. Students participate in a variety of hands-on labs and study topics in depth through project-based learning units, which connect science lab-based experiences with classroom instruction.

## Literacy
Phonics training begins in kindergarten and expands during each academic year, with an emphasis on building vocabulary, reading comprehension, analysis, and other higher-order thinking skills. In upper elementary school, reading comprehension and literary analysis are emphasized using poetry, short stories, fiction, and nonfiction.

Your child is encouraged to practice their reading skills across the academic disciplines. Their learnings are reinforced in our science and social studies classrooms, where students are encouraged to analyze, deduce, evaluate, formulate opinions, and make connections.The reading/writing connection is emphasized, and the themes used in reading tasks are also covered in writing assignments, which give students the opportunity to practice writing in different ways.

Our learners engage with writing through the workshop method, in which they're encouraged to write and think for themselves. Students learn the mechanics of writing—spelling, grammar, handwriting, and organization—as an integral part of both verbal and written communications. After being exposed to various writing styles through literary connections and classroom workshops, Village students take written pieces from draft to publication.

## Social Studies
Social Studies introduces children to history, geography, and map making skills . Much of the focus in social studies is on hands-on activities and projects, films, video and field trips. Geography and mapping skills are integrated with the aim of helping students understand themselves and the world before them.

## Technology
The technology program develops a sense of computer literacy in each student. Students perform various computer operations, experience new technologies, and learn to use that knowledge in a responsible and independent manner. The use of technology is integrated in other subject areas of the curriculum.


Computers and iPads in the Classroom:

Reinforce skills in other subject areas
Practice keyboarding
Learn new programs
Research information
Create projects through word processing and other programs
Explore new ideas

Computer Lab:

Increase computer literacy
Learn proper keyboarding techniques
Learn word processing and other programs used in classroom-generated projects
Learn to use the Internet correctly and safely
Learn to create multimedia projects
Explore coding and robotics

## Physical Education
Activites are designed to provide daily exercise, friendly competition, and relationship building among peers. Students learn how to use their bodies more efficienty & knowledgably through a wide variety of fundametal sports. Students are tested on good sportsmanship, coordination, & motor skills.
