## Elementary Curriculum
In kindergarten through 2nd grade, your child establishes a firm foundation in reading, phonics, spelling, writing, mathematics, science, and social studies. In addition to these core subjects, instruction in art, music, technology integration, Spanish and French languages, and physical education all enhance your child’s learning experience.

Each child is individually supported in Village’s learning community with relationships and resources that foster confidence, problem solving, creativity and a love of learning.

In Grades 3 and 4, your child receives instruction that provides the best preparation for their continued learning and growth. This includes departmentalizing the 3rd and 4th grade classes, which are taught by specialized teachers.

The following teaching areas are important components of our elementary school curriculum:



## Mathematics
Our mathematics program focuses on problem solving and the development of higher-order critical thinking skills, through real world application. Our curriculum presents mathematics in a logical progression designed to reduce learning gaps, develop persistence in problem solving, and prepare students to understand advanced mathematical concepts.

## Science
Our curriculum is based around hands-on study of Quranic, Earth, and Life sciences. Students engage in the scientific process of questioning and reasoning behind why the world works while referencing back to the Holy Quran. The science program supports a variety of hands-on labs and study topics.

## Literacy
Our English Language Arts program focus on core fundamentals like reading, writing, speaking, & listening. Phonics training begins in kindergarten and expands during each academic year, with an emphasis on building vocabulary, reading comprehension, analysis, and other higher-order thinking skills. In grades 3rd to 5th, reading comprehension and literary analysis are emphasized using poetry, short stories, fiction, and nonfiction.


## Social Studies
Social Studies introduces children to history, geography, and map making skills . Much of the focus in social studies is on hands-on activities and projects, films, video and field trips. Geography and mapping skills are integrated with the aim of helping students understand themselves and the world before them.

## Technology
The technology program develops a sense of computer literacy in each student. Students perform various computer operations, experience new technologies, and learn to use that knowledge in a responsible and independent manner. The use of technology is integrated in other subject areas of the curriculum.
